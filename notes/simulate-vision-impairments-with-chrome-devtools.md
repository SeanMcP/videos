Hey Dev and welcome back to another video.

Today we're going to learn how to simulate vision impairments with the Chrome DevTools.

For this video, I will be using Chrome version {{ READ VERSION }

Let's begin.

First, start on any page that you want to assess. I'm going to use the popular shots page on Dribbble to give a wide array of designs.

Next, open the dev tools. I'm going to use the keyboard shortcut, control shift I or command option I.

Next, open the "Console Drawer" if it's not already.

You can do that by hitting escape or going through the kabob menu, these three vertical dots.

We need the "Rendering" tab, so go to the drawer's kabob menu and select "Rendering."

There are a lot of options here, but we're going to scroll down to the bottom and look for "Emulate vision deficiencies"

This select menu gives us a few options to simulate vision impairments.

The first is blurred vision. You can see how small details are lost when the content is blurred.

The next are Protanopia and Deuteranopia. These are an inability to distinguish between red and green. Notice of the design changes.

Tritanopia is an inability to tell the difference between blue and green, purple and red, and yellow and pink. It also makes colors look less bright.

Achromatopsia is a partial or total absence of color vision. And you can see that all the color is gone from the page.

These are not perfect simulations, and nothing can make you see the way another individual does.

But using these emulations, you can get a better sense of what your site will look like to individuals with one of these vision impairments.

I'll leave some links for building more accessible applications and web sites in the description.

In this video, we learned about how to simulate vision impairments with the Chrome DevTools.

That's all for now. I'll see you in the next video.
